- **Profile & Resume:** Edit personal profile, upload multi-format resumes (PDF, DOCX), trigger AI resume parsing, view calculated profile strength score.
- **Job Discovery & Application:** Browse live job postings, search with filters (skills, location, salary, job type), apply to jobs, save bookmark jobs, track real-time application status (`applied`, `reviewing`, `shortlisted`, `interviewing`, `offered`, `hired`, `rejected`).
- **Communication & Alerts:** Receive in-app notifications, receive system transactional emails, send messages to recruiters, view company profiles, view salary benchmarks, request referral links.

### Recruiter Capabilities
- **Company & Job Postings:** Submit corporate KYC verification documents, post new job openings (requires admin approval), edit/close job postings.
- **Applicant Pipeline Management:** Review applicant queue, view AI candidate match scores, move candidates across pipeline stages, view candidate resumes (logged in `resume_access_log`).
- **Communication & Scheduling:** Message candidates directly, schedule video interviews (Daily.co integration), send credentials, view recruitment analytics.

### Admin Capabilities
- **Platform Governance:** Approve or reject pending recruiter accounts and corporate documents using the in-app interactive document viewer (`DocViewerModal`).
- **Job Approval Queue:** Review, approve, or reject recruiter job postings.
- **User & Account Management:** Search candidates/recruiters across multi-field queries, trigger bulk status updates (`active`, `suspended`, `delete`), perform irreversible hard account deletions.
- **Security & System Observability:** Inspect real-time audit logs (`admin-audit-logs`), track system telemetry & performance metrics, issue broadcast announcements, inspect quarantined files.

> [!WARNING]
> **Self-Service Account Deletion Gap:** There is currently no self-service "Delete Account" button in the candidate or recruiter user settings. Account deletion is currently initiated exclusively by system administrators. Public privacy policies should outline a manual deletion request workflow via `privacy@talentmesh.in` until self-service deletion is released.
