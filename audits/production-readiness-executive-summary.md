# TalentMesh AI Recruiting Platform — Deep Production Readiness Audit

**Audit Date:** 2026-06-11  
**Auditors:** Principal Staff SaaS Architect, Security Lead, and Product Reviewer  
**Status:** 🚀 Controlled Production Release Recommended

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit evaluates the operational readiness, security posture, frontend/backend architecture, observability, and UI usability of the **TalentMesh AI Recruiting Platform**. 

All Core Features have been successfully stashed, type-checked, compiled, and verified via Playwright E2E testing. The system incorporates enterprise-grade governance controls, including HMAC-SHA256 token hashing, role-based idle timeouts, active-throttled heartbeats, multi-tab BroadcastChannel state sync, device revocation, and storage quarantine retention buckets. 

However, critical gaps remain in **Recruiter Team RBAC** (lack of sub-roles), **MFA Enforcement policies**, and **Centralized Observability logging** that should be resolved during a Controlled Production rollout before proceeding to General Availability.

## 2. Production Scores

### Overall Score: **88 / 100**

| Role / Module | Score | Assessment | Key Strengths |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Candidate Module** | **93 / 100** | Mature | Robust resume uploads, automatic primary backfills, stashed 7-day quarantine, and status tracking. |
| **Recruiter Module** | **78 / 100** | Needs Upgrade | Good pipelines and scorecard reviews, but lacks team sub-role separation and domain duplicates mapping. |
| **Admin Module** | **92 / 100** | Production Ready | Comprehensive dashboard widgets, audited impersonation (`impersonated_by` UUID logged), device list, and quarantine manager. |
| **Platform / Core** | **90 / 100** | Production Ready | Lease-based cron locks, HMAC-SHA256 session fingerprints, active-event heartbeats, and Next.js Turbopack build compliance. |

## 3. Detailed Audit Findings

### 3.1 P0 Issues (Critical)
*None*. All critical data corruption risks, concurrency locks, and primary resume anomalies have been mitigated.

### 3.2 P1 Issues (High)
1. **Recruiter Company Team Privilege Mismatch (Recruiter Module)**
   * **Issue**: Any recruiter under a company profile has full admin permissions. A standard recruiter can change billing details, delete other recruiters, and modify company profiles.
   * **Affected Roles**: Recruiter
   * **Files**: [team-access-audit.md](file:///d:/Talentmesh-AI-Recruiting-/audits/roles/recruiter/team-access-audit.md)
   * **Recommendation**: Add a `recruiter_role` enum (`admin`, `recruiter`, `coordinator`) in the database schema and enforce access checks on settings updates.
2. **Missing MFA Forced Enrollment for Admins (Auth & Session)**
   * **Issue**: Administrative users can bypass MFA enrollment on onboarding, raising credentials-compromise risk.
   * **Affected Roles**: Admin, Recruiter
   * **Files**: [security-audit.md](file:///d:/Talentmesh-AI-Recruiting-/audits/roles/candidate/security-audit.md)
   * **Recommendation**: Implement a server-enforced middleware check requiring MFA enrollment before accessing administrative portals.
3. **Client-Only Observability Log Storage (Observability)**
   * **Issue**: Traces are only saved to the user's browser `localStorage`. System errors and timeouts are invisible to DevOps/SRE unless manually exported by the user.
   * **Affected Roles**: Platform Admin
   * **Files**: [observability-audit.md](file:///d:/Talentmesh-AI-Recruiting-/audits/roles/platform/observability-audit.md)
   * **Recommendation**: Sync client error and timeout logs to a central database table (`client_traces`) via `navigator.sendBeacon`.
